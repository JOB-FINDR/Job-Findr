# Technical Requirements
Your full-stack application must meet the following technical requirements:

[] Have a SPA frontend, built with React, consisting of multiple views and implementing all CRUD actions.
[x] Have a REST API backend built with ExpressJS, MongoDB and Mongoose, that your React app will communicate with.
[] Have a REST API backend with routes that perform all CRUD actions for at least one model (excluding the user model).
[] Have 3 database models or more. Having one model for users is the first step. The other two (or more) models should represent the main functionality of your app.
[] Include sign-up, log-in and log-out functionality with encrypted passwords (or social login) and authorization (logged-in users can do additional things).
[] Have two separate repos on GitHub. One repo is for your frontend React application and the other is for your backend REST API.
[] Have at least 2 commits per day that you worked on.
[] Have a backend validation and centralized error handling in your REST API.
[] Be deployed online, allowing anyone to access and use your app.
[] As a final step, check all the features outlined in points 1 - 5 and ensure they are implemented and working ahead of delivery.
